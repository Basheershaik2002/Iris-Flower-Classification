# Iris-Flower-Classification

ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species based on their sepal and petal measurements. The dataset includes features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of Iris:
1.Setosa
2.Versicolor
3.Virginica
The dataset contains sepal and petal length/width measurements, and the goal is to identify the most significant features for classification while achieving high accuracy.

ðŸ”¹ Dataset Information
The dataset consists of 150 samples with the following features:

Sepal Length (cm)
Sepal Width (cm)
Petal Length (cm)
Petal Width (cm)
Species (Target variable: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

Key Steps in the Project:

1.Data Exploration and Visualization:

â€¢ Descriptive statistics of the dataset.
â€¢ Distribution and joint plots to understand the relationships between features.
â€¢ Visualizations by species to identify significant feature variations.

2.Data Preprocessing:
â€¢ The dataset is loaded, and basic data exploration is performed.
â€¢ Necessary preprocessing steps are applied to ensure the model can effectively train.

3.Model Development:
â€¢ Various machine learning models are trained and evaluated to identify the most accurate model for classifying Iris species.
â€¢ Feature selection techniques are used to determine the most significant features for species classification.

4.Model Evaluation:
â€¢Model performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and other classification metrics.

Expected Outcome:
â€¢ A machine learning model that accurately classifies Iris species based on input flower measurements.
â€¢ High accuracy achieved through model selection and evaluation.
